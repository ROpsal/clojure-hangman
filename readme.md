# Clojure Hangman #

----------
The Hangman word-guessing game hits a nice sweet spot when learning a new computer language. Not as trivial as "Hello World" but not overly difficult to implement.

This version of Hangman is written utilizing the Clojure language, version 1.8.0.  

In this project, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/ "https://gradle.org/") was utilized to build (compile) Hangman. To build Hangman, use this command:

    gradle build

To run Hangman, invoke the ```hangman.bat``` file or utilize the following command:

    java -cp c:\Clojure\clojure-1.8.0.jar;build\libs\Hangman.jar hangman

Adjust the location of the ```clojure-1.8.0.jar``` as appropriate.

A more typical approach when working with Clojure is to use the [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/ "https://leiningen.org/") system for building and running. 

The program is text based as shown by:
